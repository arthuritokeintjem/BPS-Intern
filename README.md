# 📊 BPS-Intern | Time Series Inflation Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my work as a **Data Analyst Intern at Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS)**, focusing on **time series analysis and forecasting of inflation data**. The project aims to support internal monitoring and analytical insights by applying statistical forecasting models to real-world economic data.

The primary objective of this project is to **forecast monthly inflation trends** using historical data and evaluate model performance for practical, data-driven decision making.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical inflation index data from BPS
* Build and evaluate time series forecasting models
* Generate insights to support internal monitoring and reporting
* Apply reproducible and well-documented data analysis workflows

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The project follows a structured data analysis and modeling pipeline:

1. **Data Collection** – Inflation index time series data provided by BPS
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, formatting, and handling missing values
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Trend and pattern analysis
4. **Modeling** – Forecasting using statistical time series models
5. **Evaluation** – Performance comparison using forecasting metrics
6. **Visualization & Reporting** – Clear visual outputs for interpretation

## 🧮 Model Used

### SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA with Exogenous Variables)

* Captures trend, seasonality, and residual components
* Suitable for economic and inflation time series data
* Evaluated using standard forecasting error metrics

---

## 📊 Results & Insights

* Successfully generated **monthly inflation forecasts**
* Model captured seasonal patterns present in inflation data
* Forecast results can support **early trend detection** and internal monitoring

> Detailed results, visualizations, and evaluation metrics are available in the notebook.
